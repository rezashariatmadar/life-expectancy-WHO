    "2. **🏥 Healthcare Access Key**: Adult Mortality (-0.696 correlation) is our second strongest\n",
    "3. **📊 Realistic Expectations**: We can confidently target **R² = 0.75-0.85** (not just guessing)\n",
    "4. **🌍 Regional Strategy**: Discovered 18.6-year gap between Europe/Africa - need regional models\n",
    "5. **🔍 Smart Preprocessing**: Know exactly which missing data to prioritize (Population 22%, Hepatitis B 19%, GDP 15%)\n",

    "   - Hepatitis B (19% missing): Development-status-aware imputation  \n",
    "   - GDP (15% missing): Economic trend interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering** (based on EDA insights):\n",
    "   - Health Access Index (Adult Mortality + healthcare indicators)\n",
    "   - Education-Economy Index (Schooling + Income Composition)\n",
    "   - Regional dummy variables (Europe, Africa, Asia, Americas)\n",
    "\n",

    "**What's your preference? Should we:**\n",
    "1. **Start with data preprocessing** (implement our missing data strategy)\n",
    "2. **Build a quick baseline model** (test our EDA predictions)  \n",
    "3. **Explore regional modeling** (leverage the geographic insights)\n",
